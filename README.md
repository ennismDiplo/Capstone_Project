# Capstone Project

The capstone project is designed to demonstrate the student's ability to process and analyze large volumes of unstructured text. One of the major goals of this project is to create a product (ShinyApp) to highlight a prediction algorithm built by the student and to provide an interface that can be accessed by others. At the end, the student  will provide:

A Shiny app that takes as input a phrase (multiple words or a single word) in a text input box and outputs a prediction of the next word, similar to the predictive text functions found on today's modern smart phones, and

A slide deck consisting of no more than 5 slides, created with R Studio Presenter to, with; a description of the algorithm used to make the prediction, and describe the app, give instructions, and describe how it functions.
